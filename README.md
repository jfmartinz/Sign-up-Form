## Learnings & Challenges
During the development process, I encountered several challenges and struggled with various aspects of the project. These struggles provided valuable learning opportunities and helped me enhance my skills as a web developer. Some of the major challenges I faced include:

- **Responsiveness:** I haven't fully achieved an amazing look across different screen sizes with this website, I recognize the importance of optimizing the code and implementing best practices. I will make this site responsive in the future.
  
- **Layout:** At working this project I faced challenges in arranging the left and right content of the page. However, I successfully resolved it by using the `float: left;` CSS property. Though I initially felt frustrated, but somehow made it.

Working on this form project has been a valuable learning experience for me. I gained practical knowledge in:

- **Creating forms:** By doing this project, I was able to gain familiarity with working on forms, including form validations and styling.

- **PseudoClasses:** Creating this form project was instrumental in helping me become familiar with using pseudo-classes. I learned how to select input fields and labels based on their attributes, expanding my knowledge of CSS.

- **Proficiency in HTML & CSS:** This project served as excellent practice for honing my HTML and CSS skills. By building this simple form, I was able to reinforce my understanding and proficiency in these fundamental web development technologies.
